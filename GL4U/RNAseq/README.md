# GL4U: RNA sequencing (RNAseq)

## About
This directory holds the training materials used for each RNAseq bootcamp conducted. The [NASA GeneLab](https://genelab.nasa.gov/) Data Processing team updates the [RNAseq standard processing pipeline](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq) annually in collaboration with the [GeneLab Analysis Working Group (AWG)](https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg/charter) members, and subsequently updates the training materials used for the RNAseq bootcamp to ensure the bootcamps utilize the current pipeline. Click on a RNAseq bootcamp link below to access installation instructions and the training materials used during that bootcamp.
