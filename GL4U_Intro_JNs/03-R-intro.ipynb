Don't be intimidated if some code or a large codeblock looks like it makes no sense to you at first. That is common even for folks who use R regularly! It often takes breaking things down piece-by-piece to figure out what they are doing, and then putting them together slowly to do what we'd like. And many of us start with code from somewhere else first (whether it's from a previous project of our own, examples from a tutorial, or somewhere else), and then modify that code to eventually get it to do what we want.
