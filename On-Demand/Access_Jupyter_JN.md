## Jupyter Introduction 

We'll start with an introduction to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) hands-on activity using a Jupyter Notebook within a Jupyter Lab environment.  
> Note: We'll be using GitPod, so if you haven't done so already, follow [these instructions](../GitPod_Instructions.md) to get your GitPod account set up.

1. **Open GitPod:** Click the button below to launch an interactive Gitpod workspace with JupyterLab and all necessary dependencies installed.

12. Once complete, download the completed JN to your computer by clicking "File" in the top left corner then "Download" as shown below:
    > Note: Keep track of where on your computer you download your completed JN.

13. Next, export your completed JN as an HTML file by clicking "File" then "Save and Export Notebook As" then "HTML" as shown below:  
    > Note: Keep track of where on your computer you download the HTML version of your completed JN.

14. Shutdown your Jupyter Lab environment by clicking "File" then "Shut Down" and confirm your shutdown by clicking the "Shut Down" button in the pop-up window that appears as shown below:

15. You will see your GitPod shutting down as indicated by the following icon.

16. You are now ready to return to Canvas and upload your completed JN and HTML files, that you downloaded in steps 12 and 13 above, to show you successfully completed this hands-on activity.
